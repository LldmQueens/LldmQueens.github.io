                    <p>The Apostle of JesusChrist, Naas&#243;n Joaqu&#237;n Garc&#237;a,

                    current International Director of the Light of the World church,

                    was born May 7 1969, in the city of Guadalajara, Jalisco.

                    As a child of the late Apostle Samuel Joaqu&#237;n Flores and wife

                    Eva Garc&#237;a L&#243;pez, he is the fifth of eight children procreated

                    by the marriage. He lived his infant and adolescent years in his hometown

                    of Hermosa Provincia (Beautiful Province).
                </p>

                <p>

                    From his teenage years onward, the Apostle Naas&#243;n Joaqu&#237;n

                    experienced the satisfaction that comes from offering service to God.
                </p>

                <p>

                    &rtrif; In 1983, at the age of 14, he took his first step in his profession

                    of faith: he was baptized in the name of JesusChrist.</br>

                    &rtrif; In the following years, while still in his adolescence, along with other youth,

                    he integrated himself to the Group of Laborers of the Beautiful Province, where

                    he developed his evangelizational work while in the provinces of the Zona Metropolitana of

                    Guadalajara.</br>

                    &rtrif; Similarly, during the mid eighties, he accompanied a

                    group of missionaries that were located in the country of Spain. His time spent in the Iberian peninsula

                    , which included giving testimony of the Christian faith throughout the homes and plazas

                    , became an experience that would be forever recorded in his memory.</br>

                    &rtrif; Another blessing that he experienced was, without a doubt, having accompanied his father, the

                    Apostle Samuel Joaqu&#237;n, in trips within the Mexican Republic

                     and abroad.</br>

                    &rtrif; At the age of 17, brother

                    Naas&#243;n Joaqu&#237;n assumes his first responsibility: the Apostle

                    Samuel Joaqu&#237;n places him in charge of the younger group of teenagers in the church

                    of the Beautiful Province, on August 25 1986.</br>

                    &rtrif; Subsequently, on May 10 1992, he was placed in charge of the older youth group

                    , and on June 14 of that same year, he married

                    sister Alma Zamora Espinoza, in Guadalajara, with whom he engendered

                    three children: Adoraim, Eldai and Sibma.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In his 28 year trajectory of pastoral work, he was in charge of the following congregations  from

                    December 1992 to December 2014:</br>

                    Phoenix and Tucson, AZ; Huntington Park, CA; Southern Los &Aacute;ngeles, CA;

                    Santa Mar&#237;a, CA; Los &Aacute;ngeles, CA; San Diego, CA; Santa Ana, CA.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During the course of his work as a minister, he was anointed as

                    Deacon Evangelist (1994), and later Pastor Evangelist (2000).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alongside his work as pastor, the Apostle Naas&#243;n Joaqu&#237;n

                    devotedly took on other responsibilities: he was director of the

                    Northern Jurisdiction of the Light of the World church (2003-2014), which included

                    the states of Baja California, Baja California South, Sonora, Chihuahua,

                    Nuevo Le&#243;n and Tamaulipas, in which he took on the supervision and

                    care of the spiritual and material needs of the congregations

                    within said demarcations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With the purpose of promoting the spread of the Christian doctrine

                    through mediums of communication, the Apostle Naas&#243;n

                    Joaqu&#237;n designed and organized &ldquo;Comunication Center Berea USA&rdquo;

                    (CCB USA). This instance of media, that began operating in

                    August 2009, besides having a cultural and disseminating focus,

                    is responsible for transmiting video signal of the most relevant events in

                    the Light of the World church &minus;holy suppers, Apostolic presentations

                    , temple inaugurations, biblical studies,

                    etc.&minus; on a global scale.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For reasons of time, I will not expand on

                    the support he gave to the platform of professionals in the neighboring country&minus;

                    The Association of Professionals & Students (APS), nor of the civic service trips

                    in favor of human rights, freedom of beliefs,

                    secular education, and anti-discrimination&minus; which took place in 2007

                    and 2009 in the northern regions of the Mexican Republic&minus;, nor of his proximity with

                    authorities in education amongst other actions worthy of praise.
                </p>

                </p>

                    <span>Beginning of his Apostolic ministry</span>

                <p>
                    On December 8 2014, at 6:10 in the morning, the Apostle of

                    JesusChrist Samuel Joaqu&#237;n &minus; who directed the Light of the World

                    church for 50 years, departed to rest with the just. On that day

                    , minutes after his passing, brother Naas&#243;n Joaqu&#237;n

                    searched for a space in one the rooms of his father's house where, afflicted by the situation

                    , he presented a prayer to God: &ldquo;Console me Lord

                    &excl; I am in great pain Lord&excl;&rdquo;. The divine response did not tardy:

                     in that prayer, the Apostle of JesusChrist heard a powerful voice,

                     a voice like thunder, like streams of many waters, that said:

                </p>

                    <blockquote>

                        &ldquo;Why do you ask me for consolation, if your the consolation of my people&quest;&mldr;

                    Naas&#243;n, you will be in front of this great people; and if you see them numerous today

                    , I will multiply them even more&excl; Honor the body of my

                    servant Samuel and on the following Sunday you will rise to the people&mldr; I will open

                    their hearts, and of the Ministral Body as one single man, and I will make the perfect

                    work.</br>
                    (Cf. Apostolic Letter, December 20 2014, Silao, Gto).

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                        Sunday, December 14 2014 was the appointed day. Similar to the past days, the temple

                    and it's adjacent streets

                    were completely full. In prayer and plea, the church awaited the manifestation of the

                    Apostolic Election. This sublime act, of recongnizing the identity of a Servant of God

                    , was witnessed at 2:43 in the morning. In that instant, the church and the ministers

                    recognized the Apostolic Ministry of brother Naas&#243;n Joaqu&#237;n Garc&#237;a,

                    and, unanimously, gave him their allegiance. It is well

                    to mention that this work&minus;of spiritual recognition&minus; is not of human nature,

                    since it procedes from the All Mighty, in accordance with biblical teaching.

                    In his first Apostolic message, that was impreganted with assurance,

                    hope and consolation, he recalled:
                </p>

                <p>
                    &ldquo;You were not alone, there was only a brief pause

                    . Today is the start of an era of many triumphs, of victory and glory for God.

                    Now that my time has come, I can say with liberty:

                    Naas&#243;n Joaqu&#237;n Garc&#237;a, Servant of God and Apostle of JesusChrist&rdquo;.</br></br>

                    The time of dispensation in the church of Christ is still in effect:

                    it's seal of authenticity is the presence of an Apostle. No more no less.
