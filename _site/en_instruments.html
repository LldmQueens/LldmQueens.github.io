                        Musical instruments in worship
                    </h1>

                    <p class="thesis">
                        The use of musical instruments was one of the characteristics
                        of worship that the people of Israel presented to God
                        while living under the law given to Moses.</br>
                        Subsequently, JesusChrist revealed the true manner to worship, while
                        the former - being only a shadow of the truth - is annulled, including
                        amongst other things, the use of instruments.</br>
                        Now, in the time of grace, Christ establishes spiritual worship.
                        In effect, the use of instruments in worship &mdash; apart from having
                        no use in spiritual praise &mdash; is prohibited by the Lord.

                            One of the characteristics of the church of Christ is
                            the spiritual and mindful offering of songs through voice, just as
                            Christ and his Apostles did without instruments.
